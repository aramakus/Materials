Energy consumption measures the amount of energy used in the Australian
economy. It is equal to domestic production plus imports minus exports (and
changes in stocks). It includes energy consumed in energy conversion
activities (such as electricity generation and petroleum refining), but nets off
derived or secondary fuels (such as electricity and refined oil products)
produced domestically to avoid double counting of energy. It is equivalent to
total primary energy supply. Further detail is provided in Department of the
Environment and Energy (2019) Guide to the Australian Energy Statistics
